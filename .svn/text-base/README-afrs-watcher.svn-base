AFRS-Watcher is a php script that will monitor locations on a linux filesystem specified by the user and will report the changes.  In many ways it's similar to iwatch but with many enhancements. AFRS-Watcher is also at the heart to the AFRS Daemon (still in developement).  The Daemon will be able to sync files (via rsync) in near-realtime to other servers running the AFRS-Daemon.  See the Sourceforge.net project homepage for more details.
